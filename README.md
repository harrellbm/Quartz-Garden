# Welcome to my little biosphere in the tangle of the world wide web. 

This is my attempt to create a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) full of notes, ideas and writings that I have been composing over the last six years. 

It has already grown from its very rough infancy into a fledgling garden.

I am currently using Obsidian to write, edit and manage my notes in markdown format. I then upload those files here and use the very nice quartz framework to build them into a website. You can see the site here: [https://harrellbm.github.io/Quatrz-Garden/](https://harrellbm.github.io/Quartz-Garden/).
