# Pastor Brenden's Digital Garden

This is my experimental garden.I am starting to plant it and we shall see where it goes.

I am currenlty using Obsidian to write, edit and manage my notes in markdown format. These files are then uploaded here and build into a website using the Quartz framework. You can see the site here: [https://harrellbm.github.io/Digital-Garden/](https://harrellbm.github.io/Digital-Garden/).

> Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
