# Big Picture Perspectives

- **Evolutionary Cosmology** - the idea that the world works as survival of the fittest 
- **Wholeness and Centers** - as defined by Christopher Alexander. The idea that the world is composed of abstract layered centers. The density and configuration of these centers define how much life and health there is in a part of the world. 
- **Mechanistic Cosmology**- the idea that the world is one big machine or that processes can be broken down into their constituent parts and the mechanism of what makes things work isolated and understood.
- **Dualistic Cosmology** - the idea that matter is bad and spirit is good. 
- Post-Modernism - 
- **Platonic Cosmology** - the idea that everything has a kind of disembodied "ideal" that it is leaning toward. The best things are the things that most closely meet the ideal. 
- **Two Kingdoms and [Two Kinds of Righteousness] - The distinction between humanity's relationship with God and humanity's relationship with the world and other humans.  
- [The Two Commissions]
- Meta-Narrative Cosmology - overarching story of the Bible  or can also think of the overarching story of other religions or perspectives. 

Not a fan of evolutionary cosmology

Mechanistic cosmology has crept into a lot of ways I used to approach the world but centers thinking is starting to change that. Currently experimenting and testing out how useful centers can be in the way I interact with the world and understand it.

# Cosmologies that Tend to Promote Functional Atheisms

- **Evolutionary Cosmology** 
- **Mechanistic Cosmology**

# Cosmologies incompatible with a Biblical Picture of the world

- **Dualistic Cosmology**
- **Platonic Cosmology**

# The idea that everyone has a functional cosmology¬†

The basic way we enter every situation and start to think and act in it¬†

  

Big picture cosmology can sometimes get separated or act differently than the functional frame¬†

  

Big reason is that we learn our functional cosmology through the feedback loop of lived experience so the things we have tried or seen happen are what help us judge if ‚Äúthis is the way the world works‚Äù or not


We need a cosmology that starts from broken wholeness 

Space and time are also good foundational concepts 

I like he idea of centers when it comes to describing space 

And rhythm when it comes to describing time 

Interesting connection between life and the world from biblical perspective

- Deut 12:23 and Lev 17:11,14 Life of animals and humans in their blood 
- psalm 36:9 connection between life and light 
- Psalm 56:13 light of life actually put together 
- Prov 6:23 life light and teaching 
- John 1:4 Jesus as life and light 
- John 6:33 Jesus gives life to the world 
- John 10:10 steal kill and destroy but Jesus to give life need to find that verse 
- John 8:12 Jesus uses light of life 
- Psalm 96 worship of the whole earth
