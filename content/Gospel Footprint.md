***The Big Idea***: the idea that a preschool, church members, or other groups of believers/kids being discipled are little missionaries that make a footprint in the community. 

This concept can help think about the impact a church or school has in different terms than the blanket outreach or mission language. 

Very similar to the idea of the [[Cultural Diversity Metric]] that measures the impact of a group by the number of cultures represented.
