So a kitchen could be a center because it‚Äôs where you cook. A neighborhood could be a center because it‚Äôs held together by a common road structure, etc. 

Centers are seen as smaller parts of the larger whole and are not meant to be thought of in isolation but make clear and identify the relationships that exist between different centers. Like a kitchen and dinning room usually have between each other.

It helps make clear how the world works together. 

Also centers are seen as hierarchical. With a group of smaller centers often forming a larger center. Such as many rooms in a house making up the actual house. Therefore centers can function as a way to move up and down levels of complexity within an area as well. 

Overall this seems like a very helpful way of understanding and talking about the communities and buildings we live in in a way we can actually start to understand how these communities and spaces function.

But the fuzziness of its edges are becomes less problematic. The reason is that the pond, as an entity, is focused towards its center. It creates a field of centeredness. But, obviously, this effect falls off.

Centers are not stand alone features but are formed by the configuration of the whole. So in order to define what scale of center to look at you have to first start with a ‚Äúwhole‚Äù that is really a center of a larger scale. The larger whole of human experience would be the earth. 

If the configuration of the whole changes the centers will shift even if most of the spacial configuration is similar. Meaning that even small changes can create big impacts on an overall system. The while then comes first and centers ‚Äúsettle out‚Äù of the whole with its configuration.

In other words centers are ‚Äúinduced‚Äù by the composition of the whole. 

This is in contrast to the usual perspective that a whole is made up of parts in a simple kind of arithmetic.

- symmetry 
- connnectedness
- comvexity
- homogeneity 
- boundaries 
- sharp change of feature 
These are all factors that can strengthen the presence of a center
