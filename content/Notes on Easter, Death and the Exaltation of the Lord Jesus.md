> # Partial Summary of Some Truths Related to Easter/Exaltation of the Lord Jesus
> 1. A clear theological understanding of death —including Jesus&#39; death —is necessary.
> 	a. Death—including physical death—is what happens to sinners. It is the consequence
> of sin (Genesis 3, Romans 5). To put it another way, sin is the stinger/barb in the
> hand of death (1 Cor 15). The two go together. Theologically, death is an enemy of
> God and of God&#39;s people.
> 	b. Jesus&#39; death—vicarious to be sure —is the sign of at least two things.
> 		i. Evil men performed injustice, and they killed him. Satan acted through them
> and killed the Prince of Life. It was the culmination of the authority of darkness
> (Luke 22). Evil exerted itself to the fullest.
> 		ii. God (with Jesus&#39; full and courageous consent and loving agreement) laid our
> sins upon Jesus. His suffering on the cross was theological. But his
> dying—and his being dead—is also theological. It&#39;s more closely related to
> punishment than it is to redemption. It&#39;s not the end of the story. It can&#39;t be.
> 	c. By itself, there is no saving significance to Jesus&#39; suffering and death. While he is
> dead, death has mastery over him, and he is in danger of seeing corruption. This is a
> great mystery, but no greater mystery than to say that God became a true man, or
> that God died.
> 
> 2. Beginning with Easter (= resurrection from the dead), Christ Jesus has begun a new mode of
> living.
> 	a. He is immortal and humble / lowly no longer. From conception through death, he
> voluntarily was humble / lowly, and his majesty was hidden. Now he is humble / lowly
> no longer—still human, but not humble lowly.
> 	b. He is the beginning of the one resurrection harvest. Moreover, since humanity is the
> central focus of God&#39;s entire redemptive plan for the cosmos (Romans 8), He is the
> beginning of the renewed creation. The &quot;line of redemption&quot; runs from Jesus to us to
> the cosmos. Though we deserve to be, we are not a &quot;blip.&quot;
> 	c. In history and in time, he has received a new authority and grandeur. All authorit was
> given to him. He has received a name that is above every name. He has inherited a
> name far greater even than the angels. Evil and Satan did not win, and they do not/
> will NOT have the last word
> 	d. Raised in connection with / by the Holy Spirit, Jesus now gives the Holy Spirit to all
> believers, and to his whole church.
> 
> 3. Risen from the dead, Jesus&#39; work continues for all, and for all who believe / are baptized into
> Him.
> 	a. Because Jesus, our Representative/the second Adam, was vindicated / justified in his
> resurrection, we are vindicated/ justified/ put in the right with God.
> 
> 	b. Because Jesus, our perfect High Priest, has entered God&#39;s presence to present/
> sprinkle his blood before God, he has completed his sacrificial atonement to cleanse
> us from our guilt and shame, and he is now continually interceding for us before the
> Father who eagerly receives his intercession to forgive, sustain, strengthen, and help
> us.
> 	c. Because Jesus has begun to live a new sort of life and because we are joined to him,
> we also begin to (1) have eternal life, and to (2) receive gifts from God through Jesus
> constantly, and (3) to have the Spirit-driven power as those who are alive from the
> dead to respond in loving obedience to God and love for our neighbor.
> 	d. Because Jesus is risen as the first-fruits, our final resurrection to incorruption, glory,
> and power is guaranteed—both by his once-for-all resurrection and by the Holy Spirit
> who has been given to us as a down-payment of that final glorious inheritance.
