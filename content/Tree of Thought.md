I can actually uses [[Digital Gardening]] style note taking to create a more linear tree of though that is more flexible and dynamic than traditional written forms of essay or books but is not so disorganized that they thoughts do not hold together as a progression and cohesive whole.

Links for this style of writing need to be more thought out and lead naturally one to another forming a tree. 

Iâ€™m not sure at what point a strict tree will break down in its usefulness so that will be seen as we go 

Long form essays are starting to be come unwieldy for me. They are hard to keep track of edit and improve. They also donâ€™t lend themselves towards concise reusable writing. So I am hopeful this will be a way to organize my thoughts and writing in a more extensible and useable format.
