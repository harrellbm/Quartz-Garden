Rhythms are the basic way of seeing the world 

Wholeness and centers are the way the way we can notice and talk about these rhythms in the tangible world around us 

Creation account
- first thing Created us light and the basic rhythm of day and night 
- Later this rhythm is reproached but is put into a tangible form with light sources and heavily bodies 
- Day two is the creation of a spacial reality 
- Then other days flesh this out with land sea and animals 
- humans are spatial and time bound creatures in line with the rest of the creation
