***The Big Idea***: 

* * *

Technostress is not being able to cope with the pace of change

Digital overload not being able to cope with the amount of data and communication getting thrown at you¬†

Technophobia physical and mental stress due to being confronted with new technology at a rate faster than you can manage or keep up with.¬†

  

Advent of LLM and ChatGPT, LangChain, Stable-Diffusion

  

How to we cope with change in a healthy way

  

How to we keep faith in the center in the face of techno salvation and techno end times

  

What is the proper place for technology¬†

  

Role of human memory in the face of machine memory¬†¬†

  

The role of technology often comes down to the simple discussion of what kind of work can be offloaded from humans and entrusted to the technology. The ethical question then becomes SHOULD that work be offloaded? What are the benefits of offloading it? What do humans lose by not being directly responsible for this part of the work?

  

Another line of inquiry is to think about the growing reality that we live in a world where a particular person needs to keep in their minds less and less information in order to be functional. How does living in a world where I don‚Äôt need to know much to survive affect the way we live and interact with each other and the world?¬†

  

I think that this helps us realize the importance of memory and learning Scripture. In a world where we can offload so much information and work to technology the truly important things are the things of faith and life flowing from that. 

[[The Preservation of Tail Knowledge]]

  

The conversation that government and society affects or lives is one that is not unfamiliar. Laws and social movements put pressure on us and our loved ones to think and live a certain way. Technology is connected with this in part but I think we often fail to see the underlying narratives that drive the adoptions and development of many technologies.¬†

  

Avoiding Vendor lockin¬†

  

Open source philosophy¬†

  

Is AI making your life easier or just giving you one more thing to do?

  

Why AI? Why now?

It's not going away

We have been using it for a long time without even thinking about it

Google Translate, etc.

  

General AI Best Practices

Check for bias and accuracy: always double check before sharing with students.

The 80-20 approach: Use AI for initial work, but make sure to add your final touch, review for bias and accuracy, and contextualize for the last 20.

Production of rubrics

Production as assignments

Time management for teachers

The last 20% is vital for teachers - they have to be the ones to complete it. The 80% teaches, the 20% puts it into practice.

Our judgment matters

Know the limit - things may be out-of-date. It may represent a worldview that we don't want to tell our students something we don't agree with. Know the ultimate source of knowledge.

Protect Privacy - never use personal information or student personal information.

  

Teacher Workflow

Chat GPT (free)

The prompt you put in dictates how well of a response you will get back.

Plug in an idea for a lesson and add CC standards to the program

Magic School Lesson Plan (free, but there is a pro plan at $100 per year)

Takes an idea and makes an entire lesson plan

Made for teachers

Creates assignments

Following the language model teachers have been trained in (objectives, assessments, opening, intro, guided practice, independent practice, etc.)

Gives opportunity to ask questions about the lesson

Support for differentiated learning needs through text leveler - you can even get texts from outside sources, copy and paste, and make it at a different reading level.

Even can use Lexile levels in some situations.

Creates different types of questions that can be used at all levels.

Give teachers the platform for creating rubrics based on the lesson that was just developed.

Gamma Presentation (free)

Produces documents, presentations, and websites

Good platform to begin a presentation with options for tailoring it to you.

Magic School Investigation

Inservice worthy?

This is a good place to start with teachers because it is:

Applicable PK-8

Simple to use

Free

Useful for missing topics or lessons within an established curriculum

Look into:

How can this be used in reading?

Theology strong?

  

Other topics
