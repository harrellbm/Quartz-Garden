- Justification and other Gospel metaphors
- New Heaven and New Earth. Eschatology  
- Sin = Death, and Sin = Separation. 
- Three Biblical Words for sin and their accompanying metaphors:
	- Incurvatus in se (Latin) - A life lived turning inward on oneself - need to look it up again
	- Concupiscence - malformed desires of the heart - way of speaking about sin in the confessions
	- Hebrew (Chata) and Greek (Hamartia) - Missing the mark. Like an archer missing the target.
- Theodicy. Defending God’s hidden attributes. 
- Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi (Law of Prayer becomes Law of Faith). Practice proceeds Theology.
- Goodness of the Law and danger of antiNomianism 
- Pastoral Office and the Priesthood of All Believers
- Lutheran Potholes: Rationalism, Legalism, [[repristination]] and Law/Gospel reductionism.
