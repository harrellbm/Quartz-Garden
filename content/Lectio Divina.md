***The Big Idea***: Four step method for devotionally reading Scripture. Used as OS #📃Epistle Jan 2023.

* * *

> “I have asked one thing from the Lord; it is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, gazing on the beauty of the Lord and seeking him in his temple” 
> - Psalm 27:4

Reaching back into the history of the Church, we find many helpful ideas and practices. We are not the first people to desire, or seek, to live faithful Christian lives. Christians from other times and places have also sought to better understand and practice our common faith. Not only that, but the perspectives and practices of our Brothers and Sisters from across history can help open our eyes to things we might miss with our 21st century perspective.

 A few epistles ago we talked about the biblical roots of meditation as quietly speaking the words of Scripture to ourselves.  Christians have been meditating and digesting the words of God like this for thousands of years. In the words of Psalm 27: “gazing on the beauty of the Lord.” Devotional reading of Scripture has taken many different shapes over the centuries as Christians have navigated things like poor access to Bibles or inability to read. But one thing has remained the same: the power, assurance, and truth we seek to find in these very words of God. 

One particular way our ancestors went about meditating on Scripture is a practice called Lectio Divina (which is really just Latin for divine reading). This method of reading Scripture is focused on slowing down and letting the words of Scripture affect us. If we truly believe that God is active in His word, then we should come to Scripture expecting to encounter God. The practice of lectio divina can help us do just that by providing a structure to read Scripture intentionality.   

The most basic way to practice lectio divina is to read a section of scripture following these four steps.  Each step is meant to help you calm yourself and focus on a different aspect of the text.

- **Lectio**:  Reading - We begin by simply reading the passage.  You may read it once or several times to let the words start to become familiar.  As you read, pay attention to the words, how they work with one another, how each word weighs one on another coming together as a whole.  Think about how the words affect you personally. What are they saying to you? What sticks out to you?  If a particular word or phrase stands out to you, take time to read it again. You may like to write this phrase down or underline it in your Bible.

- **Mediato**:  Meditate - Take time to fully allow the words of this section to sit with you. Think of them like a friend you want to get to know better.  Spend time with them, allow the Holy Spirit to open your eyes to see and hear these words.  Don’t worry about distractions, instead allow the distraction to further develop in you these words of Scripture.  Allow them to become very personal, what is it this word says about you, about your life situation, about God. 

- **Oratio**:  Prayer - Spend some time talking to God about what he has spoken to you through these words.  Ask him to continue to use this moment to grow and cultivate your relationship with Him.  How will they grow and change the way you see the world? What do they mean for the way you live you life?  Offer all these things up to God in a prayerful conversation with Him. 

- **Contemplatio**:  Contemplate - Simply rest in the amazing words you have taken time to digest. Let Jesus meet you here in this place. He has been speaking to you this whole time.  Let yourself relax into this place of intimacy with God.   

I hope that you find this ancient practice something helpful to add to your personal faith life.  Think of it as one tool to help us intentionally come to God’s word, to really let Jesus speak into our lives with the live breathing words of God.
