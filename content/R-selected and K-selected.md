On a quick read seems interesting but very steeped in evolutionary cosmology. The basic value of â€œsurvival of the fittestâ€œ is the underlying value of success and failure. If a thing survives it is therefore good and the things that dies must have been bad. A basis that is completely separate from moral or ethical basis of Christianity.
