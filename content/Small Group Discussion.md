***The Big Idea***: Type of [[Pedagogy]]

* * *


**Place on Continuum**: Small Group Discussion

**Method Description**: 
Each group is given a guide sheet that directs them to passages for consideration.¬† Each passage is followed by a series of 4 to 6 questions.¬† These questions should start by asking about details of the text you want to highlight, then progress to open ended questions about the text, and finally ask about the application to their lives today.

**Additional Considerations**: 
You will want to encourage groups to be comfortable with one another and speak freely. This might be accomplished through some introductory ‚Äúopening up‚Äù questions or through the overall structure of the class.
