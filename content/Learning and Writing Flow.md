***The Big Idea***: 

* * *
- Omnivore for newsletters, subscriptions and quick stashing online content that is interesting 
- Zotero for physical book, and more long term resource cataloging. So basically add stuff to Zotero when it has reached the level of being actually useful rather than just interesting 
- Obsidian for notes management 
- Typst for formal typesetting of content once complete 
- Google docs for general docs and sharing collaboration
