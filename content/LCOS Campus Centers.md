>[!Summary] The Big Idea
> The overview of centers as I have come to see and think about them across the LCOS Campus. The whole that these centers relate to and come from in this current iteration of a centers map is the physical campus of LCOS. 

Todo: Eventually I would like to create a centers map for the surrounding neighborhood as well as Santa Maria in general. Also could center make smaller wholes like the sanctuary and preschool spaces. 

Basic concepts from: 
[[Thinking of Spacial Relationships as Centers]]
[[Notes on the Nature of Order]]

- **Preschool Center**. Both preschool buildings and surrounding playgrounds and also bleeds into big field and parking lot.
