# Fundraising 
Budget factors to consider 
- registration, hotel, food, team building activities and travel 
- How are costs for adult leaders covered?
How to distribute funds 
- To everyone equally 
- Need based 
- According to participation (watch out for tax implications!). If people are getting ‚Äúpaid‚Äù for an event then it can considered employment by the IRS. It‚Äôs not nonprofit then so be careful!
- Also you can‚Äôt directly sponsor a kid because it won‚Äôt count as a tax write off. It has to be more general (x cost is what is needed to sponsor a student). If a sponsor directly pays for one person it is a payment not a donation. 
Fundraising best to practices 
- how can you reach beyond your congregation?
- Marketing. What should be done inside or outside the congregation. Small fundraiser 4 weeks ahead get out info. Big fundraiser 8-10 weeks get info out. 
- Are there requirements for participation?
	- Make sure the expectations for participation in fundraising is clear from the get go. 

Meals are popular way 

Auctions, garage sales, bake sales, donation gifts for different levels of giving 

Selling things fundraiser 

Small business fair sponsored by the church 

Envelop fundraiser good last option

A t shirt sale not just for the kids but also for the whole congregation.  Also have a send off service where the whole congregation can wear their shirts 
# Travel 
Decide about whether you want to DIY or use a travel agent 
- more control, and could save some money,  but you are it for figuring out hiccups 
- Travel agent can figure stuff out and get things rebooked if stuff goes wrong but a little more price 
How could you coop travel with nearby churches? Need to make sure you have a good plan and working relationships 

Air travel 
- utilize group travel if your group is larger than 10-15. Needs set up with TSA but can be worth it 
- Confirm TSA requirements and stuff kids need 
- Make sure to have lots of extra time 
- Plan and budget for ground transportation after flights 

Rail
- book early use group sales 
- Make sure you know how baggage works. Can check two bags for free
- Slower but could be used for team building and together time before and after gathering 
- Also plan for late or missed trains 

Road 
- personal vehicles 
	- Double check insurance and driver requirements 
	- Make sure you have enough drivers 
	- Plan the route and where to stop before hand 
	- Plan car groupings and if there is a strategic break up or not 
- Rental vehicles 
	- Make sure insurance will cover it from church 
	- Also make sure that you check in with vendor and don‚Äôt get canceled or not have availability 
	- If they overbooked they are responsible for getting you in vehicles 
- Charter bus
	- Budget to tip appropriately 
	- Book early 
	- Provide accommodations for bus driver. Does not have to be at the same hotel but can be out where it is easier to park the bus.
	- Plan route and stops and communicate that with the vendor before you book 
- Reserve and budget for parking 
- Some hotels will have paid parking some won‚Äôt 
- Sometimes it‚Äôs cheaper to find non hotel parking
