***The Big Idea***: With the rise of AI and the deterioration of search engines (i.e. you can pay enough to be the first result), preserving knowledge that can not be easily accessed because it is not in the main distribution  (i.e. [[Tail Knowledge and Knowledge Collapse]]) will be increasingly important. Because realistically good solid theology will most likely find itself in the tail.

Consensus truth vs real truth 

Ai will serve up stuff from the center of the normal distribution 

How do we as a community preserve truth when it sits in the tails of the distribution?
