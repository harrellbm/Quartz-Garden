>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?”
>- Romans 8:35 

Paul’s resounding answer to this question is nothing!  No one, or thing, can separate us from the love of Christ.  As we step into a new school year that feels more uncertain than any of us had hoped, the core of who we are hasn't changed one bit. Christ’s love is the center of who we are and will shape the way we navigate all the ups and downs this school year will bring. And the wonderful thing about all of this is that we don’t have to do any of this alone.  

If you ever find yourself in need of prayer, or other support, you can always reach out to the Caring staff here at OS or the wonderful community of faith gathered in this place.  Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ - nothing.  May God grant us the strength to remind each other of this every day.  Amen.
