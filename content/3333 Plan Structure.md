> `Importance`: 10%

> A way of structuring a plan that breaks actions into the first three days, the first three weeks, the first three months, and the first three years. A way to kind of ease into a situation and have things basically organized. 

In addition, this kind of plan is often broken up into different "frames", that help break each time period into specific areas of importance. 

I think this might be a little over kill for a useful plan just in the fact that it is hard to know what is realistically possible in three years. I think a one year time horizon is easier to conceptualize for me.

# First Three Days

## HR Frame

Think about what needs to happen around personal job and family needs. Does Insurance need switched, do you need to find a place to live, etc. 

## Structural Frame 

Think about what things need to happen within the structure of the organization. What information do I need from specific people, what paper work needs finished, in other words, what organizational cogs need to get started spinning, etc. 

## Political Frame 

Think about the social network within the new context. What are important players and their investment in this transition? How can I connect with them?

## Symbolic Frame

Think about the core ideology and mission driving a place, is there coherence between stated mission and behavioral evidence? How can I find that out and affect it in a positive direction?
