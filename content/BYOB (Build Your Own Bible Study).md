***The Big Idea***: Type of [[Pedagogy]]

**Place on Continuum**: Teacher Led Discussion

**Method Description**: 
Each class begins with the discussion of the dayâ€™s theme.Â  This should take up no more than a quarter of the class.Â  In small groups, the students then look for Bible verses that speak towards the theme for the class and discuss the connections they see.Â  For some participants, it will be beneficial to provide a list of potential passages.Â  This study helps students to practice the skill of going to Scripture with questions and seeking out answers.Â  The bulk of the conversation will come from students justifying the passages they have connected.

**Additional Considerations**: 
This structure does require problem solving and a high level of participation from the participants.Â  It will require a significant amount of buy in.
