# Physical Form Factor

A prayer walk guide could take on many forms like a sign or little plaques. But all of those forms deeply restrict the amount of material that can be presented in an engaging and accessible way. Composing a trifold prayer walk guide would offer a larger space to present the prayer walk as well as tutorials on practices that can be used while walking. It also is a flexible medium that can be updated and changed easily as well as taken home by people who find value in them. It can also serve as a kind of “map” for people to physically take with them along the walk or out on other walks as well. 

The basic idea then is to have a set of trifolds to help guide people through using the prayer walk. 

There could be two main types:

- Introductory - overview of the prayer walk and what it is and basics on using it
- Seasonal - special seasonal walks that have a theme connected with the church year or a portion of Scripture. 

# Seasonal Themes: 

- Stations of the cross - [prayer guide from my home church](https://www.stpaulsfallschurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Stations_of_the_Cross.St_._Pauls2.pdf) 
- Days of creation 
- Lament 
- Christmas O antiphons - [Lutheran Witness articles](https://witness.lcms.org/2020/o-sapientia/) 

# Outline of Basic Prayer Walk Guide:

- Prayer is having a conversation with God

- Practice for slowing down with the Lord’s Prayer 

- Christian meditation explained (as opposed to eastern meditation) 

- Practice for praying a piece of Scripture 

- Using or body in Prayer 

- Practice of breath prayer (more accessible than talking about kneeling, or other physical postures of prayer)
