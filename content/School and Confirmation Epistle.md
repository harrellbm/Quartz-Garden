***The Big Idea***: Used in OS #📃Epistle September 2023

Our Savior’s is full of the hum of school life once again.  It is exciting to be embarking on another school year where the love and grace of Jesus can be shared with our school children big and small. It is such a blessing to be able to provide a Christ centered education for these children as a Church and School community.  

One particularly meaningful connection point happened with our Third Graders on the first full day of school. Each year the third grade receives their own adult Bible they will keep with them through the rest of their time in school with us. In order to mark this amazing milestone, we held a Bible blessing for the class.  Their excitement and wonder was infectious as they each held their very own Bibles. School wide chapel has also resumed each Wednesday as an opportunity for the whole school to come together around the word of God and Jesus' love for them. Our Savior’s school is a truly unique environment. It is a place where the future of our Church and local community is being shaped each and every day through the hard work and care of our dedicated teaching staff. 

The lives of our young people are not only being shaped within our School but also through the launch of our new Confirmation curriculum. Our Pastoral Team have been thinking, praying, and building this curriculum for almost two full years and are excited to be finally launching it this fall. Through it we are excited to engage our young people in volunteer service, thoughtful teaching, meaningful connections with mentors, and times of fellowship and fun. We seek to offer opportunities for our confirmands to not only know the right things, but also be able to put them into action in their lives. 

As we embark on this journey together, we appreciate your continued support in prayer and encouragement as we share the good gifts of Jesus.  The gifts that He has freely given to each of us.
