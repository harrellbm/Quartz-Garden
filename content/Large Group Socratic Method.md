**Place on Continuum**: Teacher Led

**Method Description**: 
Break the material up into large units of understanding that can be united with a single question.Â Lead off with that bigger question for each unit and then ask a series of smaller, more accessible questions, to lead people towards an understanding of the bigger question.

**Additional Considerations**: 
This structure requires you to consider the range of different answers and thought processes that the individuals in your class might go through, at times requiring gentle course correction.
