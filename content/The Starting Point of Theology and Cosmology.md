For example, [[Christopher Alexander (Architect, Author)]] starts with the simple desire to build good buildings. And so his work is intensely grounded while also being abstract enough to apply it to any new building project. 

Frank Senn starts from a very intense focus on the role of embodiment and its importance for all of life and so his treatment of liturgy comes from a very different place than discussing liturgy from a doctrinal or historical starting point.
