***The Big Idea***: During Martin Lutherâ€™s time as a monk he would have no doubt used this[[Lectio Divina]] method. And in fact he adapted the steps to follow the pattern of reading scripture he saw pop up over and over throughout Psalm 119.

****


Psalm 119 is the longest of the Psalms and has a line of poetry for every letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Throughout Luther points out three main things the Psalmist does over and over with Gods wordÂ 

- **Oratio or Prayer** - we start with prayer we read with prayer. It mingles with and is an essential part of our reading scriptureÂ 


- **Meditatio or Meditation**- example of a kid that canâ€™t get enough of something. Itâ€™s about reputation speaking reading seeking. Having a conversation with God by asking questions and paying attention to what is happening inside youÂ 

- **Tentatio or Temptation** - Satan will always try to drag you down once you have learned or grown. He wants drag you away for God and his word but God can turn what is meant for evil as the means to drive us back to his word of truth and love and comfortÂ
