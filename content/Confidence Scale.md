***The Big Idea***: I have implemented a simple confidence scale to help show my certainty for a note. This helps differentiate concepts that I agree with but have not taken the time to investigate verse those that I have and either strongly agree or disagree with. 

****

- #ðŸ”´Uncertain  A note containing a concept or idea that could have potential but I am tentative about. 

- #ðŸŸ¡Consideration A note containing a concept or idea that I am actively processing and thinking about. I have some confidence in it but not enough to say I believe or fully adhere to it. 

- #ðŸŸ¢Conviction A note containing a concept or idea that I fully support and believe.
