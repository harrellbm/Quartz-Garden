***The Big Idea***:  I really like the potential of pairing nature based, child led, exploratory learning with the theological concept of [[Creatureliness]] they seem to pair nicely. If we are creature made of dirt with the breath of God in us put over creation as co-creators and co-rules than exploring the tangible physical surroundings of our earth is a natural way to learn that connects with our very basic created nature.
