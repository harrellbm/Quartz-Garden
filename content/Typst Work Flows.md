# Readings
As it stands right now I have a typst template to generate readings when I copy paste them over from biblegateway. I would like to get a powershell script to be able to auto pull the readings and load them into a json. then I could use a typst template to auto generate the readings from there. that way the only thing I need to do each week is literally put in the readings address and boom the readings are done. this probably requires installing typst locally though so that I can directly run the compiler after fetching the readings. 

# Worship Planning
I think I have a nice template that will help me stay organized with sermons and other service details. I basically have a function that auto generates the skeleton for me for each element. I have it so that when I start I can bulk copy paste reading titles form yaag.org and then can split things out as I go.
