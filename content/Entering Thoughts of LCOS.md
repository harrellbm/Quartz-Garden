Try to provide some personal and communicable structure to an otherwise chaotic time.Â 

River of wellbeing metaphorÂ 

Pursue Hospitality. Rom 12:1-2, do not be conformed to the world. Rom 12:9-18 what it looks like to live as a Christian in love. Paul talks about how to live as church but also how to respond to the world outside. This is a great section on rhythms.Â 

  

What is hospitality. The Greek word is a combination of two words.

Philo - loveÂ 

Xenia- strange.Â 

Which means love of those who are strange. That is what hospitality is itâ€™s messy and hard.

Core CultureÂ 

**Warmth** - is characterized by displaying kindness and welcome and value to othersÂ 

**Challenge** - willingness to share to truth in love so that all my remains and know the saving faith of Jesus ChristÂ 

**Grace** - echoing of Gods love and forgiveness of us to others

  

Acclimatization

Forming, storming, norming

  

Metaphor of fish in a bag in a new tankÂ
