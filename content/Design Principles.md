Looking to history and nature are two places to help find inspiration as well as learn about what makes a good design.Â 

Principles are a framework to help refine and analyze not a blind checklistÂ 

## Basic principlesÂ 
  
**Contrast** - color differences. The most stark being black on whiteÂ 

**Variety** - circle example of no variety, oval example of shape with varietyÂ 
  
**Repetition** - taking the same line or shape and repeating itÂ 

**Symmetry** - the same thing on both sides of a base lineÂ 

**Radiation** - lines or shapes spreading out from center pointÂ 

Use of grid to help keep track of placement of shapes and lines in a patternÂ 

Decorative Design is not a degradation of natural forms but inventive forms in and of themselves that are enriched by the study of nature

Balance of imitative principle of copying things from nature and the inventive principle of using abstract forms creativelyÂ

## From Architecture as Pedagogy by David OrrÂ 

Basically makes the argument that building teach us about what we think about the earth and the world around us and how we relate to other humans
## From Mapping a sense of place by hicks and king

Mapping experiences are a way to think through the meaning embedded in the natural and built parts of our environment and see how it differs from othersÂ 
## From Personal and Public Place by Guinan

Hearing and learning about the stories of people who have built or live in a place helps make architecture more meaningful and helps us be more empathetic**
