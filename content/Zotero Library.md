***The Big Idea***: ideas and todos for organizing my Zotero library

* * *

## TodosÂ 
- [ ] Backup whole library in a github repoÂ 
- [ ] Create pattern for ai tag generatorÂ 
- [ ] Share with Philip and NateÂ 
- [ ] Reorganize collections to only be by resource typeÂ 

## Things to Catalog
- [ ] Church orgsÂ 
- [ ] GitHub toolsÂ 
- [ ] Google drive notesÂ 
- [ ] BooklistÂ 

## Collection SpecÂ 
No more than one level of subfolders per main folderÂ 

Folders are only for resource type tags should handle all topic or other categoriesÂ 

You can assign multiple tags to a single resource based on its content and relevance. For example, a commentary on the book of Romans could be tagged with "Biblical Studies," "New Testament," "Romans," and potentially relevant themes like "Soteriology" or "Justification."

This tagging system provides a structured way to organize your library based on subject categories, sub-categories, scripture references, and themes or topics of interest. You can further refine or expand the tags as needed to suit your specific needs and the growth of your library over time.
