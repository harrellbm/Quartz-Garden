 >[!Summary] The Big Idea
 Stuff I have learned or what to remember about taking notes in Obsidian.

> [!note] Notes
> - The easiest way for me to sign into git for backing up to a private git repo is using VSCode
> - I also find VSCode to be the easiest way to handle merge conflicts or other errors that pop up with files occasionally during backups. 
> - That being said the git obsidian plugin is the best for day to day backups.
