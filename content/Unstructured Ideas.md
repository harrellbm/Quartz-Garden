The three pronged approach of scripture itself should be what shapes they way we teach and tell the story of everything. Torah (narrative and law), nevaim (prophets), ketavem (writings). Narrative, poetry, and prose discourseÂ

An Introduction to the New Testament: Contexts, Methods & Ministry Formation

by David A. deSilva

  

Narrative is the foundation of our biblical understanding. We see normal broken humans living there lives. We see God and his revaluation of dealing with and working through these broken people.

  

Poetry takes the messy and engages it. We see the prayers of the faithful in the Psalms. The vision of the world as it is and will be through the prophets. Poetry peels back the layer of our normal perception of the world and calls us to look deeper and see God in the midst of the messiness of lifeÂ 

  

Prose discourse takes the logical, theÂ 

  

Both poetry and prose discourse look back at the stories to explain and grow our understanding and experience of God. Paul speaks of Jesus and his life giving sacrifice. But without the narrative of Jesus on the cross the discourse is flat and disconnected. The psalms pray to a God who feels far away yet is worth praising and waiting for. Without the stories of Gods faithfulness these prayers are gibberish. Narrative is the base from which the other forms of scriptural communication derive and deepen meaning.Â 

  

The logical progression of Scriptural introduction then is: narrative, poetry, prose discourse. Yet we often jump straight to prose discourse in the way we even teach the narrative or think about the poetry. An alternative model could be pulled from the organization of the New Testament itself. Narrative, discourse, poetry. While Old Testament has barely any prose discourse other than legal an ceremonial statements. Regardless of exactly how this shakes out it seems clear that prose discourse is not the primary means of communication that the Scriptures present the word of God through. How should that shape the way we think about teaching Godâ€™s word to a world that has increasingly less time to sit and debate with level heads?Â
