# General Notes 
From a top layer look I am using the basic Stack of: 
- Obsidian for note writing and editing 
- GitHub for note backup and website hosting 
- Quartz as the site generator 
# Setting Up the Website
- start by forking the quartz repository (otherwise itâ€™s a pain later)
- locally clone fork and set up locally. Guide for doing this: [getting started](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
- then build and preview the site to make sure everything is working: [build and preview](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build)
- then set up the GitHub action for hosting with github. Do this first without any fancy stuff to set it up easier by just using the test page: [hosting](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting)
- Obsidian plugins I use:
	- Update Time on Edit plugin for keeping track of when note was planted and edited last 
	- Tag wrangler plugin for making it easier to deal with tags 
	- Callout manger and editing toolbar plugins are nice to just make editing easier
	- Git plugin on desktop to push to a separate github repo that saves the raw obsidian markdown files
	- Use an app called PolyGit on IPhone to push backups from phone. The way I have it set up is that there are two copies of my vault on my phone. One is used by the Obsidian app to save to. The other is used by polygit to sync when remote. I have two iPhone shortcuts that automatically copy to and from the vault used by the obsidian app. Itâ€™s not a great solution but makes it so I can keep my phone and comp in sync without having to pay for anything.
- using [quatrz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) for static site generation (work comp had restrictions but no issue on home laptop)
	- Had issues getting npx to work was able to use `node quartz/bootstrap-cli.mjs` followed by the command instead 
	- very easy to just us `-d` option to specify the envelop repo I cloned back down
- Todo: write down all the settings I have used
- Todo: start by uploading my finished essays and linking them and creating definition pages 

> [!NOTE]
> You can change the icon and banner of your Quartz site by changing the image files under quartz/static to whatever icon you want
