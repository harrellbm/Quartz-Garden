Jesus talks about how valuable the kingdom of heaven is and he zeros in on Scripture near the end of our reading for today.Â 

Matthew 13:52 (ESV): Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.
  
Scribe is being used here like the original job Someone deeply familiar with scripture and in charge of making new copies of it. But ultimately teaching and living itÂ 

New being the kingdom of heaven Jesus is bringing into the world and fulfilling the old covenant. So new and Old Testament new and old covenants. Brought forth together as valuableÂ 

Even though we can hear this parable and accept that Godâ€™s word is important, actually Reading scripture is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. We all know that we should read our Bibles but there are a lot of things that can get in the way

One of the biggest ones is not feeling like you know how to read it. Or that a particular part doesnâ€™t make senseÂ 

I think part of that difficulty is that we usually read things we donâ€™t have to stop and think about. Most of what you read during a day is meant to communicate things as quickly as possibleÂ 

But scripture is like that storehouse full of all kinds of treasures. Itâ€™s not meant to just be quickly read and then moved on. We are supposed to sit with it and let it soak into usÂ 

A while ago I taught you guys about one way to read scripture called [[Lectio Divina]]. It is a beautiful way to read scripture using four steps:Â 

Lectio - read

Meditatio - meditateÂ 

Oratio - prayÂ 

Complatio - contemplateÂ 

This is one really good way to help us sit with Scripture and let it teach usÂ 

During Martin Lutherâ€™s time as a monk would have no doubt used this lectio divina method. And in fact he adapted the steps to follow the pattern of reading scripture he saw pop up over and over throughout Psalm 119 - [[Oratio, Meditatio, Tentatio]]

Psalm 119 is the longest of the Psalms and has a line of poetry for every letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Throughout Luther points out three main things the Psalmist does over and over with Gods wordÂ 

Oratio or Prayer - we start with prayer we read with prayer. It mingles with and is an essential part of our reading scriptureÂ   

Meditatio or Meditation- example of a kid that canâ€™t get enough of something. Itâ€™s about reputation speaking reading seeking. Having a conversation with God by asking questions and paying attention to what is happening inside youÂ 

Tentatio or Temptation - Satan will always try to drag you down once you have learned or grown. He wants drag you away for God and his word but God can turn what is meant for evil as the means to drive us back to his word of truth and love and comfortÂ 

Letâ€™s read part of Psalm 119 and see where Luther got theseÂ 

  

Psalm 119:145â€“152 (CSB): 145Â 

I call with all my heart; answer me, Lord.Â 

I will obey your statutes.Â 

146 I call to you; save me,Â 

and I will keep your decrees.Â 

  

147 I rise before dawn and cry out for help;Â 

I put my hope in your word.Â 

148 I am awake through each watch of the nightÂ 

to meditate on your promise.Â 

149 In keeping with your faithful love, hear my voice. Lord, give me life in keeping with your justice.Â 

  

150 Those who pursue evil plansï»¿, come near;Â 

they are far from your instruction.Â 

151 You are near, Lord,Â 

and all your commands are true.Â 

152 Long ago I learned from your decreesÂ 

that you have established them forever.

  

Letâ€™s try it out on some of the parables we read today. They are nice and shortÂ 

Matthew 13:44 (ESV): The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

  

Matthew 13:45â€“46 (ESV): Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, 46 who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.

There are so many ways to read scripture that bring us into a place where we can absorb what scripture is telling us. But ultimately they all have the same goal that we would not just acknowledge but deeply proclaim that the kingdoms of Heaven is more valuable than anything else in life**
