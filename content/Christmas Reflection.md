***The Big Idea***:  Used in OS #📃Epistle Dec 2022 

Ah the wonderful, busy, crazy Christmas season is here! As we think about spending time with our families and preparing for traditions. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on this time of year with you.  

While big turkey dinners, hallmark movies, hot chocolate, and so many other sights and smells meet us during this time of year, it is tempting to feel like everything has to be perfect. And if it is not, then something is wrong with me or maybe the life I find myself in.  While this season is so often associated with joy and thanksgiving. The reality of life in the winter, or life without a loved one, finds us facing different struggles during the holiday season than we did when the weather was warm. 

Each of us has our own story. Some enter winter without a second thought, the regular pattern of the seasons brings on just a little different way of living. But for others, as the light fades faster and the outdoors feels less inviting, life can feel like a thousand pounds got added overnight. Add on top of that all the stress of planning, preparing and executing so many expectations that come from a million directions and what is meant to be a joy filled time turns into one that is dreaded instead.

Not only that, but this time of year has a special way of bringing up the past. Past Thanksgivings, or Advents or Christmas eves. All wrapped with layer after layer of memory. Good memories, bad memories and everything in between. And if these celebrations take place without one who helped make your memories of the past, the pain can be deafening, no matter how many carols are sung. 

In the world these darker realities of the Christmas season get swept under the rug. “Just be happy”, “Why aren’t you over this yet”, “I think you’re being dramatic.”  But within God’s church we have a different message to share. You are not alone. You have brothers and sisters who care about you no matter what you may be going through.  If you find yourself dealing with a less than happy Christmas, reach out to your church family. Because after all, Jesus is the reason for the season and He died to make us His family for this Christmas and an eternity to come.  

 >“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.” 
>- 2 Corinthians 1:3-4
