# Discernment

Concept Proposal. Take brainstormed ideas and start to put them into concept plans. Add picture ideas, basic pricing estimates, and other rationale.  Basically make it so that you can present a concept to a group and gather further input and approval or rejection before proceeding to further planning. This is when it is easier to throw out or pause an idea if there is lots of resistance.
