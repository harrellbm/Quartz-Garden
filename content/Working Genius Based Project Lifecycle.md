***The Big Idea***: **Using the framework of the 6 working geniuses to help structure moving a project from an idea to real actions

****
# Wonder

Principle Discussions. Use thesis, principles or guiding questions to help spark discussion and brainstorming in a helpful direction.Â Â 

# Invention

Brainstorming Discussions. Continue a principle discussion to work toward generating solutions and ideas to move things forward.Â 

# Discernment

Concept Proposal. Take brainstormed ideas and start to put them into concept plans. Add picture ideas, basic pricing estimates, and other rationale.Â  Basically make it so that you can present a concept to a group and gather further input and approval or rejection before proceeding to further planning. This is when it is easier to throw out or pause an idea if there is lots of resistance.Â 

# Galvanizing

Final Proposal. Beef up a concept proposal to include all the needed info to start implementing the project. Specifics about cost and buying materials, plan for volunteers and any other people needed, etc.Â 

# Enablement

Launch Project. Actually start launching the project and helping people to move forward in their roles.

# Tenacity

Stick to Completion. Stick with the project until it makes it all the way through.**
