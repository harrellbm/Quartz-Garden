***The Big Idea***: The overall structure I have developed to help easily identify the purpose and function of various notes.

****
## Beginning Note Metadata 
These are pieces of information I will attach to the beginning of each note that helps give clearer context to how I view the ideas and information contained. 

1. **Note Dates**:
	>Important dates to help frame the note’s life cycle:
	>- Date a note was planted. 
	>- Date note was last tended 

>[!Note] 
>Both dates are auto added/updated using the "Update time on edit" community plugin.
2. **Epistemic Disclosure**:
	Tags to make clear the level of work put into an idea:
	- #🌱Seed an idea that is intriguing but has had very little development. In other words, they are interesting tidbits that I may do more with in the future. 
	- #🪴Sprout an idea that has been developed and thought about, but not put into any kind of final form.
	- #🌿Sapling an idea that has the starts of a final form.
	- #🌳Tree an idea that had matured into a more well rounded line of thought.
	- #🍋Fruit Essays, poems, projects, or other more polished forms of writing. They are independently useful products of a line of thought or initiative. 
3. **Idea Sentiment**: 
	My personal opinion/acceptance of the idea held within a note:
	- #🤢Strongly-Disagree
	- #😟Disagree 
	- #😐Neutral 
	- #🙂Agree
	- #😁Strongly-Agree
4. **Confidence Level**:
	The [[Confidence Scale]] associated with the ideas or concepts contained within the current note:
	- #🔴Uncertain 
	- #🟡Consideration 
	- #🟢Conviction 
5. **Special Note Types**:
	Tags that identify notes that function for me in special ways:
	- #🌲Evergreen A running note that is continually updated. 
	- #📊Project A note focused on completing a goal or building something. 
	- #📖Story A personal or interesting story I would like to save for personal memory and possible use in a sermon.
	- #📝Essay A more polished written essay on a particular subject. 
	- #📃Epistle A Short form writing that I generally send out once a month to my congregation on a particular thought or idea. Not a full treatment but kind of a devotional reading. 
	- #🗣Sermon An oral presentation for a worship service that I have presented. I tend to keep notes in short from so they tend to not be full manuscripts. 
	- #📚Definition A note that holds a kind of dictionary style definition of a word or phrase.
	- #✒️Poem A personal or quoted poem.
6. **Idea Importance**:
	I will use a sliding percentage rating to make clear how important the current note is to me. Something like:
	- **Importance**: 62%
7. **No topic tags!!!** I find them hard to manage and keep track of as well as unnecessarily condensing the content of a note. Instead I will strive to make connections between notes using internal links. 
### Example Note Metadata 
This is an example of the current metadata I have composed to start each note. For ease of use I have created an [Obsidian Template](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) to insert this data pre-formatted. Otherwise I would 100% forget to start notes with it or drift with its style over time.
