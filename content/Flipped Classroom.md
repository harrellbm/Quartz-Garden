***The Big Idea***: Type of [[Pedagogy]]

* * *

**Place on Continuum**: Small Group Discussion

**Method Description**: 
In the first class, come to an agreement on a way to interact with the text together at home. One suggestion might be to use different color highlighters to mark different themes.Â  Each participant then will read the assigned text during the week and interact with the text in the agreed upon way.Â  When the class comes together, walk through the text and lead a discussion based on the interactions that participants had during the week.

**Additional Considerations**: 
This structure does require a bit of homework and an openness to discussion.Â  It should only be attempted with groups who are up to the challenge.
