***The Big Idea***: Ideas for how to teach using visual aids or resources.

* * *

Poster of the big picture story of BibleÂ 
- Simple in like five stepsÂ 
- More detailed in like twelveÂ 
- Longest in twenty fourÂ 

This would go with CreedÂ 

Psalm 78 story of Godâ€™s peopleâ€™s failureÂ 

Poster on Lordâ€™s Prayer and prayingÂ 

Poster on baptism and baptismal remembranceÂ 

Poster on confession and absolutionÂ 

Poster on communion
  

Poster on Ten Commandments and Godâ€™s blue print for our lifeÂ 

  

First level should be for pre literate and key word learning

  

Next level is still visual but has a bit more words for early readers for memorization and reading practice. Books of the Bible should be in hereÂ 

  

Final level is for oral and critical thinking in question answer format still need some visual but not the main focusÂ
