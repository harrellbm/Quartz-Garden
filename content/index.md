Hello! üëãüèª 
My name is Brenden Harrell. I am a Husband, Father, Lutheran Pastor, and Tinkerer.

You have stubbled upon an experiment of mine. I have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the exhausting, overwhelming and overstimulating digital spaces we inhabit. Content is constantly being pushed, or marketed, to us in new shiny wrappers. Why not try something different?

My hope is that this site will be more like a little quiet wilderness. A place to slow down, explore, start conversations, and collaborate. That is why I have named it - *The Aspen Grove*.

# The Calm after the Storm

Aspen trees never used to mean much to me. I'd look out into the forest and see an unformed mass of green and brown. Until one day, a memory was frozen into my brain. 

I was sixteen - old enough to be confident I understood the world - and young enough to believe it.  

I was on the epic adventure of boy scouting: backpacking in the back country of New Mexico. We hiked up and down the mountains of the Philmont reservation carrying everything we needed on our backs. On this particular day, we had hiked from the early light of dawn until we saw the vague pillars of trees pass us by with the extinguishing of the sun. Finally, flashlights bobbed and dropped as we fumbled to set up out tents in the dark. As if the dark was not complicated enough, a cool stormy breeze began to blow. The exhausted frantic shuffle ensued to erect our tents before the coming rain. I remember zipping the tent's door as a boom of thunder echoed against the mountain's heavy sides. That night can only be described as breath taking. The rumbles shook the ground I laid on while the wind whipped the trees. 

I woke the next morning to the soft bubble of a stream I hadn't noticed the night before. As I emerged from my little burrow, I stepped into the middle of a perfectly untouched aspen grove. The calm completely captivated me. Cream trunks surrounded us in every direction with the little creek winding its way past. The light softly filtered through bright green leaves as if the storm the night before was only a dream. 

At that moment, aspen trees began to mean something to me. But the amazing thing about aspens is that no aspen tree is alone. Under the surface, all those individual trees are growing together as one. Each connected to the other by the roots.

# Connected by the Roots

Just like that aspen grove in the rocky mountains, I aim to make this digital space a grove of thoughts, ideas, concepts, notes and experiences. 

It‚Äôs a little like a blog, but also very different. The basic concept of this site was inspired by the idea of [[Digital Gardening]]. The main idea is to create a place to plant ideas and let them grow gradually. Rather than posting content that gets sent off into the torrent of data around us, a garden looks at a note as something meant to be revisited, edited and expanded.  

In other words, this is not a chronological feed of writings, but is a living network of notes I have gathered and continue to write about things that I find interesting and useful. 

I think the reason this concept resonates with me is that it mirrors my lived experience of thinking and developing ideas. No idea is at its best the first time you scribble it down. But over time a small idea can grow into something powerful.   

Therefore the nature of this garden can be summarized with the following points:

- **No note is finished.** This follows [[The Iterative Nature of Learning]]. I have added clues to the start of notes to help you see how I view them and if I have put much work into them or not. You can find more details about this here:  [[The Organization of My Digital Garden]]

- **Notes are interconnected**. This allows for [[Topological Navigation]] by using links that connect related ideas together. This creates a kind of map that allows for navigation around the garden by following paths of ideas a lot like going for a physical walk in a garden.  

By structuring this site according to these concepts, I hope to explore a different way of ‚ÄúBeing‚Äù in digital space.

# Christian Collaboration

Pastors and churches have a hard time collaborating in meaningful and open ways. In a lot of ways other than Christian colleges or seminaries there are not a lot of exchanging of ideas between churches or ministries. 

We often get stuck in [[The Packaging Trap]] which is basically always trying to market a new curriculum, or book, or journal that should just be copy pasted into a new context. Which we all know does not work. Curriculums end up being more work than just doing something yourself most of the time. They also tend to elevate the writer of producer of a curriculum above the "users" of the material. There is no kind of mutual exchange or relationship. 

So the desire of this garden is to be a space to explore collaboration that is more fluid and immediately useful for myself, but also to visitors who use this garden as a resource. I am not the end all be all, these ideas are ideas that need refined, applied, challenged, and improved. Tasks much better suited to a community than an individual working in isolation.

There is nothing to sell or package or advertised, just a humble offering of ideas and concepts that are useful to me and maybe will be useful to someone else too.

Starting conversations is far more important than publishing yet another book, or curriculum. 
# How to Use this Garden

Here are some basic notes about how you could use this garden:
- Follow a path of ideas by clicking on imbedded links as you read. See where my mind has wandered and where yours might too. 
- Use the search bar to see if I have notes on something specific. If not you could email me and see what I think!
- Look at a particular note tag and see what other notes have the same tag.
- If you run into a 404 page it means I haven't made that note yet or haven't uploaded it. If it is interesting to you reach out to me and start a conversation about it.
