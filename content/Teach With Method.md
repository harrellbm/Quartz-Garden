***The Big Idea***: rather than teach to people through lectures or being up front. Teach with by actually learning along with them. The idea for me would be to have a Bible study where everyone is actually studying a text and then comes back to talk about it. This is then based on the research done in the class and can give feedback and guidance on actual study and research methods rather than it all being prepackaged by the teacher. 

This is a type of [[Pedagogy]]
