The functioning of color is an important element within a teaching environment. Too much high saturation color can be overwhelming and counterproductive especially for individuals with particular processing difficulties.Â

In addition, painting rules help set guidelines for a coherent and unified facility.

# General Rules

1. Bright accent colors can be used in decorations and art but should not be painted on any wall in large blocks.Â Â 
2. Rooms that are dark due to windows or lighting should have brighter colors to balance the feel of the space.Â 
3. Bright rooms can have darker color combinations to help balance the space.

# Classroom and Meeting Room Rules

1. No more than one Feature color within a room.Â 
2. No more than one wall painted with the chosen feature color.
3. The wall painted with the feature color must be the main teaching wall. I.e. the one with the white board. This naturally draws attention to the teacher and teaching material on the board.
4. All other walls must be painted in one neutral color. This offers a visual break for the eyes.Â 

# Hallway Rules

1. Hallways must be painted in calm neutral colors. With the exception of bulletin boards or displays meant to draw student attention and engagement.Â 
2. A particular hallway should be painted with only one of the three neutral colors.Â 

# Common Space Rules (Entryway, Parish Hall, Cafeteria)

1. Due to their size, these rooms can accommodate more variety in design.Â 
2. That being said, colors should be placed intentionally to guide attention rather than for the sake of being colorful.Â 
3. All other wall surfaces should be painted in neutral colors.
