***The Big Idea***: A collection of a few various ways to engage Scripture.

****

Engage scripture as a conversation with God. Our relationship is with a living active loving word that came to free us from sin, death and the devil.

Engage the whole body, move, hear, speak, draw. The aim is to absorb the story of scripture into our own story. God‚Äôs story is our story and vice versa.

  

Listening styles:

Ethos - relationships with speaker

Logos - logical flow of material

Pathos - feelings evoked by material and speaker

  

Basic Learning styles:

Auditory - listen to spoken word

Visual - see images or illustrations

Kinetic - physical engagement of body

  

Types of Memory:

Semantic - logical word based memory of facts or figures

Autobiographical - memory that connects to your story of life. Or the way you process the world around you

  

Story is the type of material that sticks in our minds the easiest and stays the longest.

  

A major question we need to keep asking is how does this hook up to the greater story and images of Scripture?

  

General passive engagement:

Listen to reading

Listen in car

Read English

  

Personal engagement:

Listen to reading and draw what you hear

Draw specific scene or image from Scripture

Read the word out loud

Sing Scripture

Hand write scripture out

‚ÅÉ Pray Scripture

‚ÅÉ Memorize verse or section

‚ÅÉ Use mnemonic devices

‚ÅÉ Use mind palace

‚ÅÉ Recite while walking

‚ÅÉ Silently reflect or meditate on a specific passage

‚ÅÉ Journal personal thoughts and things that stick out from a verse

  
  

Nitty Gritty engagement:

Research book as a whole

Research section

Research verse or phrase

Study in original language
