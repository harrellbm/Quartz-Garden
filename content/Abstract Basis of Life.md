***The Big Idea***: life can be zoomed out to four main types of forces 

Basically we can think along two axises: time and space. 

## Time 
**Processes**: the longterm path ways, cycles, and forces that shape knowingly or not.

**Rhythms**: the regular occurrence of practices and events that build the processes we live in. Processes are made up of rhythms. And a rhythm can be embodied by any number of different practices.

**Practices**: the things we do in a particular way 

## Space
Spacial Configuration: like in 
[[The Quality of Life in Environments and Objects]]
