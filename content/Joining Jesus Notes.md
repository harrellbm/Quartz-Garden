***The Big Idea***: Notes from reading *Joining Jesus* by Finke. Basically lays out a model for missional communities.

* * *

Join Jesus on His mission. Not go on mission for Jesus  

We **seek, recognize and respond** to what Jesus is already doing

**Enjoying** people is what it looks like to love your neighbor.

**Seeking the Kingdom**: redemptive presence and activity of Jesus is the kingdom. We look for a place to apply a little love, truth or grace. Often comes in the form of human need.

**Hearing from Jesus**: What has Jesus been teaching you in his word?

**Talking with People**: actually getting to know people and be in community with them.

**Doing Good**: What good can you do around here?

**Ministering through Prayer**: How can we help in prayer?
