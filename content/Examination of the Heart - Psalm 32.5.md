> [!NOTE] Important notes from Josh Leborious
> # Examination of the Heart
> ## Psalm 32:5
> 
> ### Fear
> Ask yourself:
>  What do I want to preserve or avoid?
>  In this situation what or who do I fear most? -l am afraid that . . .
> Common things that we fear:
>  loss of job or position
>  loss of respect from others
>  loss of security (financial or physical)
>  loss of marriage
>  loss of children, parents, or other family members
>  loss of things like home, car, business, money, retirement
>  loss of control
> What we fear most becomes our idol. If I fear losing something important to me, I may respond in desperate ways to keep from losing it. Therefore, I sin.
> 
> Scripture
>  The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trust in the Lord is safe. Proverbs 29:25
>  Fear not those who kill the body, fear the one who can destroy body and soul. Matt. 10:28
>  God will never leave you; do not be afraid. Hebrews 13:5-6
>  The Lord is my light, salvation; whom shall I fear? Psalm 27
>  God to be feared above all gods. Psalm 96:4-5
>  God&#39;s promise: But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared. Psalm 130:4
> 
> ### LOVE (Desires, Cravings)
> Ask yourself:
>  When a certain desire or expectation is not met, do you feel frustration, resentment, bitterness,
> or anger?
>  What is consuming your thoughts and time right now?
>  All I want is . . .
> Common things that we desire:
>  everyone getting along
>  acceptance by others
>  doing what I want; get my own way
>  being in control
>  professional success/recognized achievement
>  a spouse&#39;s love/respect
>  attentive or accomplished children
>  respect from others
>  vindication in a lawsuit
> To desire things is human. But when we elevate a good desire to a demand, we end up sinning. It is a good desire to want everyone to get along. But when we demand it, we sin. When we sacrifice God&#39;s Word to have it, we sin.
> 
> Scripture
>  What cause quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are
> at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain,
> so you fight and quarrel. James 4:1-2
>  Do not gratify desires of the flesh Romans 13:13-14
>  Put to death sexual impurity . . . idolatry Colossians 3:5
>  Abstain from passions of flesh 1 Peter 2:11
>  Walk by the Spirit; not gratify desires of flesh Galatians 5:16-17
>  Keep free from love of money and be content Hebrews 13:5
>  Love the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind, strength. Mark 12:30
>  God&#39;s Promise: The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. I John 2:17
> 
> ### MISPLACED TRUST (that result in Judgments)
> Ask yourself:
>  What or who do you trust in?
>  What or who would you blindly follow?
>  What means have you used to eliminate the other person&#39;s opposition or influence?
>  How have you communicated to the other person what you feel they must do?
>  How have you threatened the other person? (Give me what I want or you will pay)
>  Misplaced Trust and Judgments are characterized by:
> o I think you . . .
> o I know what is best . . .
> o I understand this better than you do . . .
> o You know why they are . . .
> 
> This is an idolatry of self. We expect others to fear, love and trust in us. We think we are God. There is also an absence of love and concern for the other person. This idol does not demand sacrifice but an execution.
> 
> Scripture
>  Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding, be not wise in
> your own eyes; fear the Lord and turn away from evil. Proverbs 3:5, 7
>  Better to take refuge in Lord than trust in man. Psalm 118:8
>  Whoever trusts in his riches will fall. Proverbs 11:28
>  Do not be anxious; will not God provide? Matthew 6:25-34
>  Who are you to judge a brother? God? James 4:11-12
>  God opposes the proud, gives grace to humble. I Peter 5:5
>  Look to Jesus, founder and perfecter of our faith. Hebrews 12:1-3
>  God&#39;s Promise: Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
> Matthew 11:28
