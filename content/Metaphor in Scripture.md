Continuing with our look into how we as God's people can approach scripture as more than just a book to study, or a chore to complete.Â  I want to take some time to talk about an important tool used throughout Scripture to communicate meaning.Â  This is the literary tool called metaphor.Â Â 

Metaphors are shorthand for experiences.Â  They are the images and pictures repeated throughout Scripture that help us think about deep Spiritual ideas using the lens of our normal human experience.Â  They let us think about things using our experience of something else. Christ as the Groom and the Church as the Bride is a beautiful example.Â  It allows us to think about our own and the churchâ€™s relationship with Jesus using the marriages we have seen and experienced.Â  But Metaphor also helps us interpret our own experience as well.Â  For example, who Jesus is and the way He treats His Church can help us realize what a healthy husband-wife relationship should look like.Â  The metaphors used in Scripture help us go both directions.Â  On one hand using our own life experience to help us understand who God is and what He is up to, while also helping us see what our lives should look like.Â Â 

Metaphors highlight specific things about the subject we are reading.Â  Using the example of Bride and Groom again, it highlights Jesus' love and care for His people, but it also hides things like Jesus' discipline of those he loves. Each metaphor on its own helps us see specific things about the world we live in, but it also lets other things retreat into the background.Â  We can think of each metaphor as a unique snapshot. As we look at the picture we can pick out specific colors or implications.Â  And as we place picture after picture next to one another, we can begin to see the big picture of Godâ€™s great story throughout the bible.Â Â Â 

As you continue to read through Scripture.Â  Pay attention to the metaphors you run into.Â  Ask yourself what each metaphor helps highlight and what it hides.Â  Take time to stop and look at each picture and image what it describes.

A central part of Godâ€™s story is the Gospel.Â  As such there are many metaphors used throughout Scripture to describe the gospel. Each paints a particular picture of the good news we have through Jesus Christ.Â  I want to leave you with this list of Gospel metaphors to help get you started on your journey through the metaphors of Scripture:
