***The Big Idea***: Type of [[Pedagogy]].

* * *


**Place on Continuum**: Teacher Led Discussion

**Method Description**: 
Each group is given a role in the study of the text for the day.Â  Examples of these roles include someone looking for other connected passages, someone paraphrasing the text into a few sentences, someone seeking the application to daily life, or someone considering examples of the text in the modern day world.Â  Each group assigns individuals to these roles and they come back together to share what they learned or discovered.Â  If being done with a number of groups, you could split off into groups based on roles for discussion and then go back to the original groups.

**Additional Considerations**: 
You will want to be particularly prepared to provide guidance for each of the roles you are giving out in their study as well as be prepared to step in and foster some leadership within the groups.
