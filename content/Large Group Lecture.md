***The Big Idea***: Type of [[Pedagogy]]

* * *

**Place on Continuum**: Teacher Led

**Method Description**: 
The teacher walks through the text a verse or a couple verses at a time.Â  For each verse take the time to explain connections, background, and interesting details.Â  Use accessible language and explain any theological terms you feel are worthwhile to use.Â  Be sure to break up your lecture with open ended questions to discuss as a class or in small groups, with questions for individual reflection, and for appropriate media connections.Â  Do not just stand and talk for the entire class!

**Additional Considerations**: 
Make sure to use a variety of methods to keep the students engaged in the class.
