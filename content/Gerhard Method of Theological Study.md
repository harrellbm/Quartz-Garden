***The Big Idea***: This is a method for reading the BibleÂ taught by the 1600s Lutheran Gerhard. It is laid out in his book called *A Method of Theological Study*.

* * *
## Cursory readingÂ 
- 4 chapters a dayÂ 

- two of Doctrinal books (epistles, etc.)Â 
- two of historical books (Genesis, etc.)

- Summary of each chapterÂ 
- Make it through the Bible in a yearÂ 

## Deep or painstaking readingÂ 
- Textual notes using original languageÂ 
- More detailed outline of the textÂ 
- Compare the text with how it is translated in various places from different traditionsÂ 
- Resolution of apparent contradictionsÂ 
- Solid sayings if the fathersÂ 

Goal of education is creating something useful and forming the person  

Directed reading and note taking used as an important method for helping people think and meditate and growÂ 

Disputation as a learning tool. There would be someone to preside over the debate. The respondent is in charge of defending the main thesis. Opponents would be more than one who are trying to argue against the thesis. Goal was not to win but to find the true and express it as convincingly and clearly as possible.
