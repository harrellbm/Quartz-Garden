> Excerpt from personal email with Joel Biermann: 
> ‚ÄúYour subject of study is a good one, no doubt. So far as resources that address this directly, I can‚Äôt think of anything in particular. From my perspective the big point at work is the interface between vertical and horizontal realm realities. In the coram mundo aspect of our lives we do the vocations God has given us, thus fulfilling the first great commission. And in the process of carrying out those duties we find opportunities to speak the truth about Christ to those we encounter, thus doing the second great commission. So, we serve our neighbors by caring for their coram mundo needs and their coram Deo needs, and we live then as the creatures God intended. I‚Äôve attached a paper I had you read back in Systems 2 (at least I assigned it). It comes closest to establishing the working foundations and relationships between the two commissions, though that is not the specific subject. You might also check out Arand and Kolb‚Äôs Genius of Luther for some other background thinking on this.‚Äù
