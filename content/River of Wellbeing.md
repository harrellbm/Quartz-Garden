> I have been reading a book by Dr Daniel Sigel, a neuropsychiatrist, and Dr Tina Bryson, a  psychotherapist, who specialise in working with children and teenagers.  Their book, The whole-brain child: 12 revolutionary strategies to nurture your child’s developing mind, which was a New York Times’ bestseller, explores how a child’s brain functions and matures.  Importantly, it explains why children behave the way they do, and why they can appear to be out of control.  Sigel and Bryson, offer a new approach to child rearing with 12 key strategies that help healthy brain development, leading to happier and calmer children. It is an interesting read with readily appliable strategies and the next few blog posts are

> The left and right side of our brain can be imagined as the two banks of a river, the ‘River of  Wellbeing’ (Siegel &amp; Bryson, 2012), down which we float, day to day, in our own little canoe.  When life is going well, when we feel calm and not fazed by changing situations and when we feel we have an understanding of ourselves, our life and those around us, we can sit and  enjoy the journey down the river from the calmness the middle affords. All too often though as we travel throughout our day, we find ourselves being pulled closer to either bank of the river and becoming stuck. When this happens, we move further away from emotional and mental health and less able to respond flexibly to challenging situations and difficult thoughts and feelings. The two sides of the river of wellbeing are called: Chaos and Rigidity.

>## **The Bank of Chaos – Right brain**
> 
> The right side of our brain is focused on emotion, images, personal memories, intuition and  gut feelings. It sends and receive signals allowing us to communicate through facial expressions, eye contact, gestures and tone of voice. The right brain is concerned about the meaning and feeling of experiences and relationships and focuses on the big picture. It  concerns itself with the context of the situation rather than the content and is strongly  connected to our body sensations and input from the lower part of our brain, which combine together to create emotions.

> floods. When this happens, we find ourselves veering too close to the bank of Chaos, feeling overwhelmed by difficult emotions and body sensations. We can feel out of control, knocked around by the rapids close to the bank or inundated by the crashing emotional  waves. At these times, we need the perspective of our left brain to help us handle the emotions we are feeling.
> 
>## **Bank of Rigidity – Left brain**
> 
> The left brain, which comes into the picture around the time children start asking ‘why?’, is interested in cause and effect. It is the logical, literal and linguistic side of the brain, placing  things in sequential order and using language to express logic. The left brain gives us order  and structure, however it is very literal and can lose perspective. Helpfully, this side of the brain enables us to express emotion in words thus helping us ride the emotional waves coming from the right side.

> When we float too close to the bank of Rigidity, we can become inflexible and less able to adapt, negotiate and compromise. We can become too literal, losing perspective of the situation and missing the meaning of putting things into context. We can miss nonverbal cues and only hear the words spoken to us and we try to control everyone and everything. This bank of the river often feels more predictable and seems like a safe place to retreat to when we are feeling emotionally overwhelmed. The flipside to retreating however, is that the right brain and its feelings can often be ignored or denied, and we can find ourselves in an emotional desert. When this happens, we or our children often appear distant with blank expressions, voicing statements like ’I don’t care’.

> As luck would have it, we often find ourselves zig-zagging from bank to bank throughout our day, not only dealing with our own situations, but also the zig-zagging of our children who also have their own boat on their own river of wellbeing. Our challenge as parents often results from when our children are not in the flow of their own river and when they are either being too chaotic or too rigid.  For example, not sharing a toy – rigidity, losing the plot when another child takes the toy from them – chaos.
