>[!Summary] The Big Idea
> This is a [[Tree of Thought]] for the ideas surrounding what it means to be human from a biblically founded perspective that we are creatures 

Need to work out the core questions of what the world is and what humans place in it is 

What is the place and purpose of human work?

What is a healthy theology of change that comes for a biblical basis. 

What if mechanistic science is not the highest or best good when it comes to exploring and building 


# Grounded cosmology
Wholeness and centers as ways of understanding space 

Rhythm, and liturgy as ways to understand time 

God‚Äôs eternal power and divine nature can be seen clearly through creation. See Rom 1:20

Psalm 19 creation speaks of God, then move to how the law or God is good and valuable, then ends with personal application and prayer to be in sync with Gods good law and his good creation

Two Poor Mindsets about Change
- Anti-change. Tend to hold onto the past and the good old days. ‚ÄúWe have never done it that way‚Äù syndrome 
- Change as inherently good. Fast pace and relentless end up focusing on changing toward very overly specific and sometimes very short sighted objectives. 

Two valid forms of change 
- Structure preserving transformation or Smooth Change
	- This change is basically the idea that all life giving change comes from an unfolding process that starts with the current structure of the whole and makes step by step changes to enhance and extend the wholeness. This process respects the current structure and basically seeks to change the least amount of big/strong/living centers in order to maximize the positive effects of the change. Because if you introduce a new strong center but destroy two others you really haven‚Äôt improved anything. 
	- Notes that I am reading through and hope to get my hands on a full copy soon: [Link to Nature of Order Book 2 Cliff notes](http://nature-of-order.stefan-lesser.com/book-2-cliff-notes)Christopher Alexander lays out the process for how he sees structure preserving change come about.
	- Using the 15 properties of good centers or the geometry that gives them more life as also the names of structure preserving transformation that injects that particular type of strengthening into the system of centers - [list of these transformations](http://nature-of-order.stefan-lesser.com/b2-c2-fifteen-transformations)
- Radical or Disruptive change 
	- Disruption by DeYmaz is a good example of a book that lays this kind of change out. Bolsinger, Canoeing the Mountains another example.
	- The idea with this type of change is that change gets rid of the old to make space for the new. 
	- This is usually put in terms of life or death. Basically change or die. From Bolsinger
	- DeYmaz is a little less depressing and more uses the idea of disrupting a market as the kind of change he is after that the Gospel basically should come in and totally shake up an area by totally changing the name of the game. 

# Mechanistic Cosmology and the Death of Theological Wholeness 

The idea that we view scripture as incomplete which is true from a mechanistic perspective 

But this then leads to the idea that scripture only really gives an overview or some kind of spiritual perspective on how the world works 

I think that Scripture works from a wholistic standpoint of the human and the universe. We see an accurate and immensely deep and nuanced perspective of everything in scripture. The problem is that if we are looking for the mechanics of everything we won‚Äôt find it but if we are looking for a wholistic approach to life and everything than Scripture and theology is all we need 

# Need 
Start with the reason we need such an anthropology and basis for life and theology 
- [[A Creature Among Machines]]

We have lost the ability to see God in the world around us. Sure we see him in the spectacular or the stunning but hardly ever in the normal or the ordinary or even the holy that we encounter 

Vocation gets us a lot of the way there but it also doesn‚Äôt give us a practical understanding of actually doing what we say we should do. We know we are all of the roles we are for the glory of god and the reflect his light but then practically we go about all of those vocations in the exact same way as anyone else 


# The reality of competing cosmologies 

The idea the we sometimes don‚Äôt see how different cosmologies affect us 

The idea of worldview doesn‚Äôt really capture this reality 

Mechanistic nature of the universe as described by Christoper Alexander in nature of order book 1 preface 

We often operate like the world around us is a mechanistic world that God kind of just breaks into now and again but the actual daily moment by moment participation and perceptible reality of God is not there. Or if it is then we end up acting like conjurers looking for got to bend reality for our benefit or something along those lines 

Evolutionary cosmology as a way to think of change, development and ‚Äúprogress‚Äù

Both of these can come into a Christian‚Äôs interaction of the world without ever rising to the level of ‚Äúworldview‚Äù but can deeply affect how we approach and enact our vocations and life in the world 

# Foundation
Then move to the basic laying out of a creaturly anthropology. That is defined as the dependence and overlay of parts 

# Application frameworks 
Next outline the basic idea of building on this basis with the idea of common characteristics 

My work with rhythm and liturgy is off of the coming characteristic of being time bound beings 

The work of [[Christopher Alexander (Architect, Author)]] is interesting in this area since it is based on the commonality of human feelings and the basis of wholeness as essential for understanding the world. 

Many other possible common starting places that would all work legitimately off of the foundation
